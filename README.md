# checkers-game
This is a very simple implementation of the famous Checkers game, using Javascript, HTML and CSS without any framework. This project, however, uses Bootstrap (for the board grid) and a very, very basic config of Webpack to generate a single JS file.
The rules for this game was based on this [page](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers) and you can check the result [here](https://dccj-checkers-game.herokuapp.com/).
